### Hi there 👋

I'm Mengqi Liu, a second-year master student in Statistics at the University of Chicago. Here I'm fortunate to work with Prof. Barber and Prof. Aragam. Prior to UChicago, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics at Beijing Normal Unversity.

My current research interests lie in the intersection of distribution-free inference, graphical model, causal inference and generalized machine learning.

Under supervision of Dr. Renjun Xu, we replicated biologially informed network, where the first layer is randomly connected and the following layers are connected according to their gene-pathway relationships. Then we collected public data for stomach, colorectal and liver cancer, and applied the model on these three datasets, with the hope to identify domain-unique and common genetic variation sites.<br />

We worked on generating synthetic financial time series data for downstream tasks to compensate for financial data's expensiveness and scarcity. Here we used the supervised learning method, a masked autoencoder model, to complete time series generation and found its superiority in various downstream tasks such as time series classification, prediction, and imputation. . We detailed the model and its outstanding performance comparing to other benchmark models in the paper。<br />
