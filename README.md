### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mengqi Liu, a second-year master student in Statistics at the University of Chicago. Here I'm fortunate to work with Prof. Barber and Prof. Aragam. Prior to UChicago, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics at Beijing Normal Unversity.

My current research interests lie in the intersection of distribution-free inference, graphical model, causal inference and generalized machine learning.

We learned CS224 and CS231n lessons of Stanford at the beginning for subsequent research. Then we reproduced biologically informed networks in Tensorflow, where the first layer is randomly connected and the following layers are connected according to their gene-pathway relationships, in order to increase interpretability of deep learning models through biological information.  We trained it on the collected data of breast cancer, stomach cancer, etc., and discovered the commonalities and unique gene pathways of different cancers.

We tackled the challenge to generate synthetic financial time series data for downstream tasks to compensate for financial data's expensiveness and scarcity. Here we used the supervised learning method to train the masked autoencoder model to complete time series generation and found its superiority. I was mainly responsible for completing partial experimental results, comparing with some benchmark models and writing some parts in the paper.
